## :point_up: About me

I´m a junior sofware developer who wants to spend his days learning about tech. I love both, back-end and front-end paradigm althought maybe more interested in the back-end.

I´m studying physic in U.N.E.D too. I´m in love with science and nature, I like go out to nature with my prismatic to see animals and with my telescope to see space at night

I love to spend my time with my girlfriend and my dog ( :dog: Linda, a love) and my friends too.
I like to talk about everything: natural sciences, social sciences, tech, philosophy...

_Family is the most important_ **as motto**.

I like learning about software architecture, clean code, testing and good practices.
I´m learning React, Vue and I wanna learning some php framework (as symfony or laravel) as soon as possible.

I currently use Angular (8+) to my front and nodejs to my back, although I think that the languages and frameworks are a means not an end.
I use flutter to mobile apps too
